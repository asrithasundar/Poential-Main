# One-Dimensional Potential Functions Implementation
This project implements various one-dimensional potential functions and plots corresponding analytical and numerical derivatives of the potential function using the programming language Python,providing visual representations that elucidate their relationships.

## Implemented Potential Functions

The following potential functions are implemented in this project:

1. Linear Potential
2. Quadratic Potential
3. Double Well Potential

Molecular dynamic simulations use potential energy functions to study the interaction between atoms and molecules in a system. Potential energy functions that depend only on one spatial dimension are called one dimensional potential function or 1D potentials. Linear potential, quadratic potential and double well potential is simple one-dimensional potentials that can be differentiated by varying the nature of the potential function with respect to position. A potential is linear when the potential function varies linearly with position and is quadratic when the potential function varies quadratically. Whereas a double potential is a potential function that has two minima separated by a barrier and its study is of great importance in the field of molecular dynamics. This git hub repository can be used as a library of one-dimensional potential functions to run tests and observe the potentials in various studies of dynamics.
