# One-Dimensional Potential Functions Implementation
This project implements various one-dimensional potential functions using Python and  plots the potential functions alongside their corresponding analytical and numerical derivatives, providing visual representations that elucidated their relationships.

## Implemented Potential Functions

The following potential functions are implemented in this project:

 1. Linear Potential
 2. Quadratic Potential
 3. Double Well Potential
